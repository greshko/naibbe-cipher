## Abstract

In the work represented here and in the associated preprint, I investigate
the hypothesis that the Voynich Manuscript (MS 408, Yale University Beinecke
Library) is compatible with being a ciphertext by attempting to develop a
historically plausible cipher that can replicate the manuscript’s unusual
properties. The resulting cipher—a verbose homophonic substitution cipher I call
the Naibbe cipher—can be done entirely by hand with 15th-century materials, and
when it encrypts a wide range of Latin and Italian plaintexts, the resulting
ciphertexts remain fully decipherable and also reliably reproduce many key
statistical properties of the Voynich Manuscript at once. My results suggest
that the so-called “ciphertext hypothesis” for the Voynich Manuscript remains
viable, while also placing constraints on plausible substitution cipher
structures.
